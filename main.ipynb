The most common 4xx error is <b>404 (Not found).</b></p> <p>Just in case you don't know; <b>canonical links</b> are used to solve duplicate content issues. If you have several pages with the same or similar content, you need to pick the one that you want to rank.<br/>â<br/>And by pointing canonical links to that page from its copies, you explicitly tell search engines that this is the page they should index (and hopefully rank) instead of the others.<br/>â<br/>A common use case of canonical link is, for example, product variants in eCommerce shops.Â </p> <p>Here's a quick example of how it can look like:<br/>â<br/>â<code>&lt;link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://example.com/\"&gt;</code> <br/>â<br/>If you want to find out more about them, feel free to check <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google's guide</a>.</p> <p>This issue indicates that there are URLs specified as canonicals on the pages of your website that return one of the 4xx HTTP status codes. Which basically means that the page isn't accessible.Â </p> <p>If the page is not accessible for search engines, they will be unable to index it and it won't show up on the search results page.<br/>â<br/>There are various types of <b>4XX codes</b>, you can check their description here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">List of HTTP status codes</a></p> <p>Some of the issues can be easily solved. Some are trickier, and qualified assistance is highly advised here. Â </p> <p>But here's a brief overview of the 4XX HTTP issues you are likely to deal with.Â </p> <p><b>400 - Bad request</b></p> <p>This error stands for communication issues between the server and your browser. Basically, the server failed to understand the request your browser is sending.Â </p> <p>This type of HTTP code can be caused by errors in the URL, the syntax of it. You might want to check the URL in the rel=canonical for non-allowed symbols, like a percentage character, etc.Â </p> <p>Hereâs a list of <a href=\"https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unsafe URL characters</a>.</p> <p><b>401 - UnauthorizedÂ </b></p> <p>Itâs a permission issue that indicates the page is accessible only for logged in users. As you know, canonical links are meant to rank. Seeing that that page is publicly unavailable and you still want it to be so, you should either remove the canonical link to it or find the page that better suits this purpose.</p> <p><b>403 - Forbidden</b></p> <p>It has to do with permissions as well and means that the content is blocked for a specific user group.Â </p> <p>You can grant free access to it via your server or remove/replace the link.Â </p> <p><b>404 - Not found error</b></p> <p>Probably the most common 4XX HTTP status code out there. The page was either deleted or its URL has changed. Possible ways to fix it:</p> <p>make sure the URL in rel=canonical is the correct URL of the canonical page. It might have a typo.</p> <p>if the canonical page is gone, find or create a new one and set it as canonical; refrain from redirecting the old page to the new one as it will result in 'canonical points to 3xx' issue.Â </p> <p>if you donât have any substitution for the missing page, you can change the canonical tag to self-referencing</p> <p><a href=\"https://help.ahrefs.com/site-audit/terminology/what-is-health-score-and-how-is-it-calculated-in-ahrefs-site-audit\">What is Health Score and how is it calculated in Ahrefs Site Audit?</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://help.ahrefs.com/site-audit/terminology/what-is-site-audits-page-rating-and-how-do-we-calculate-it\">What is Site Audit's Page Rating and how do we calculate it?</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://help.ahrefs.com/site-audit/faqs-and-troubleshooting/i-get-an-error-message-when-setting-up-a-crawl-in-site-audit-how-do-i-fix-this\">I get an error message when setting up a crawl in Site Audit.

That is why similar or duplicate pages of your website must have a \"rel=canonical\" attribute to instruct search engines to show the most authoritative (canonical) version of the page in search results.</p> <p>If you do not use this attribute to handle duplicate content, wrong page versions can be indexed.</p> <p>Choosing a canonical URL also helps to consolidate link signals for similar or duplicate pages into one preferred URL. Also, it is a proper way to manage syndicated content as the canonical URL can point to a different domain.</p> <p>Finally, canonical URLs can optimize your crawling budget as Googlebot will not be spending crawling time on duplicate pages.</p> <p><b>Note: <br/>â</b>Even if you indicated the preferred (canonical) page version to Google using \"rel=canonical,\" Google may still choose a different page. Google uses quite a few other signals, such as http/https protocols, page quality, sitemaps, etc.</p> <p>Review all the pages with duplicate content listed in this report.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>The number in \"No. of pages having the same content\" column is clickable. If you click on it, you will get a list of pages that have the exact or very similar content to the URL in question.</p> <p>Within this group of pages, you should pick one canonical version that you want to be indexed in search results. Add its URL to the \"rel=canonical\" labeling on each page with duplicated content, including the canonical page itself.</p> <p>You can export the results into a .csv file from Site Audit if necessary.<br/>âÂ <br/>The canonical page can be specified by:</p> <p>Using the <b>rel=canonical &lt;link&gt; tag</b> in the code of a page.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>Â  Â  2. Using the rel=\"canonical\" <b>HTTP header</b> in your page response. This method is especially applicable to non-HTML documents such as PDF files that can be accessed via multiple URLs.</p> <p>Example:Â </p> <p>Only valid live pages must be specified as canonicals.

Pages are removed and deleted on almost any active site. However, fixing the \"404 page\" errors on your site is not hard and will help your website on a large scale.</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Open the list of 404 pages on your website in Ahrefs Site Audit</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Click on the number in the \"No. of inlinks\" column to get a list of pages that link to the 404 page.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Remove the link to the dead page or replace it with another relevant link to a live 200 page on each linking page.</p> <p> </p> <p>Additionally, you can set the appropriate 301 redirects on the 404 pages. It is especially important for the URLs with a decent number of external backlinks. You can set the 301 redirect from the dead page to another relevant page on your website. If you don't have a better place for the redirection, you should leave the 404 page as it is.</p> <p> </p> <p>To see the number of backlinks for the reported 404 pages, you can add the \"No. of backlinks\" column in the Data Explorer table.</p> <p> </p> <p>Plug the 404 URL into Ahrefs' <a href=\"https://app.ahrefs.com/site-explorer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Site Explorer</a> for the backlink report.</p> <p> </p> <p>Recommendations:</p> <p> </p> <p>1.

Thus your website URLs may return 5xx codes to our crawler specifically.</p> <p>If you found that the crawl happened during server maintenance, run a new crawl to see if the 5xx errors persist.</p> <p>Another possible reason for this issue in the Site Audit tool is the high crawling speed set in your project's settings. Some servers are not able to process a large number of requests at a given time. Try setting lower crawling speed in the crawl settings and run a project re-crawl.</p> <p> </p> <p aria-live=\"assertive\" id=\"__next-route-announcer__\" role=\"alert\" style=\"border: 0px; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 1px; white-space: nowrap; overflow-wrap: normal;\"></p>\n",
