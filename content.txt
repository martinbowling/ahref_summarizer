Paragraphs: This article deals with 'canonical points to 4xx' issue in Site Audit, This issue reports canonicalized URLs where canonical links point to URLs that return one of the 4xx (Client Error) HTTP status code., Example:For https://help.ahrefs.com/en/, And https://ahrefs.com/help/en/ declared as canonical, returns any of the 4xx HTTP status codes (Client Error). The most common 4xx error is 404 (Not found)., Just in case you don't know; canonical links are used to solve duplicate content issues. If you have several pages with the same or similar content, you need to pick the one that you want to rank.​And by pointing canonical links to that page from its copies, you explicitly tell search engines that this is the page they should index (and hopefully rank) instead of the others.​A common use case of canonical link is, for example, product variants in eCommerce shops. , Here's a quick example of how it can look like:​​<link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/"> ​If you want to find out more about them, feel free to check Google's guide., This issue indicates that there are URLs specified as canonicals on the pages of your website that return one of the 4xx HTTP status codes. Which basically means that the page isn't accessible. , If the page is not accessible for search engines, they will be unable to index it and it won't show up on the search results page.​There are various types of 4XX codes, you can check their description here:, List of HTTP status codes, Some of the issues can be easily solved. Some are trickier, and qualified assistance is highly advised here.  , But here's a brief overview of the 4XX HTTP issues you are likely to deal with. , 400 - Bad request, This error stands for communication issues between the server and your browser. Basically, the server failed to understand the request your browser is sending. , This type of HTTP code can be caused by errors in the URL, the syntax of it. You might want to check the URL in the rel=canonical for non-allowed symbols, like a percentage character, etc. , Here’s a list of unsafe URL characters., 401 - Unauthorized , It’s a permission issue that indicates the page is accessible only for logged in users. As you know, canonical links are meant to rank. Seeing that that page is publicly unavailable and you still want it to be so, you should either remove the canonical link to it or find the page that better suits this purpose., 403 - Forbidden, It has to do with permissions as well and means that the content is blocked for a specific user group. , You can grant free access to it via your server or remove/replace the link. , 404 - Not found error, Probably the most common 4XX HTTP status code out there. The page was either deleted or its URL has changed. Possible ways to fix it:, make sure the URL in rel=canonical is the correct URL of the canonical page. It might have a typo., if the canonical page is gone, find or create a new one and set it as canonical; refrain from redirecting the old page to the new one as it will result in 'canonical points to 3xx' issue. , if you don’t have any substitution for the missing page, you can change the canonical tag to self-referencing, What is Health Score and how is it calculated in Ahrefs Site Audit?, What is Site Audit's Page Rating and how do we calculate it?, I get an error message when setting up a crawl in Site Audit.

Paragraphs: Find out how to deal with the ‘Redirect loop’ issue in Site Audit, This issue reports redirecting URLs that cause redirect loops, Example:, Redirect loop means that the final URL never resolves and happens when a redirect chain is stuck redirecting to one of its elements. , Examples of redirect loops:, URL1 (301) → URL1 (301) → ..., URL1 (301) → URL2 (302) → URL3 (301) → URL1 (301) ..., The most common indication of a redirect loop is the error displayed in the browser when opening a page:, Open the report and check the URLs listed there. Should a URL redirect by mistake, simply change its HTTP status to 200. , Then, click on the number of inlinks. You will see a list of pages that have a link to the page with a redirect loop. Update the links so that they go directly to the 200 page. , However, on pages where a redirect is intended, replace the whole redirect chain with a single 301 redirect to a 200 page. , Redirect chains are likely to cause issues with loading speed, this is why it’s recommended to avoid them. Should they be necessary, try to keep the number of redirects under 5.,

Paragraphs: Find out how to deal with the ‘Redirected page has no incoming internal links’ issue, This issue reports pages that are only linked via a redirect., If the destination page has no incoming internal links, it can’t be reached in any other way other than through the redirect., The issue concerns only indexable pages that you actually want to be ranked. If a reported page doesn’t meet that criterion, you shouldn’t worry and can simply ignore it. , In case those are indexable pages, study closely why the destination pages don’t have any incoming links. For example, if you recently moved your site from HTTP to HTTPS, it stands to reason that your old links will go to the HTTP version first and then redirect to the HTTPS, hence, no direct internal links. To solve this problem, change the links on the referring pages so that they point to the HTTPS page directly. , Generally, it is recommended to audit your site and check your link infrastructure. Make sure that your relevant pages can be easily found. ,

Paragraphs: Find out how to deal with the ‘Self-referencing hreflang annotation missing’ issue, This issue reports pages declared as alternate language versions that don't list themselves in their hreflang annotations.,  , Example:,  , Hreflang annotations for https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/website-audit/:,  , The page must reference itself in its hreflang annotations. The following line is missing:,  , The rel="alternate" hreflang="..." tag helps manage multilingual websites by allowing you to specify language- or region-specific versions of a page. Based on this information, search engines can serve the relevant version to the users based on their language (and alternatively location).,  , All language variations of the same page need to be interlinked via hreflang annotations. In plain English, if you have About Us page in 3 different languages, each of these 3 pages need to link to the other 2 versions as well as have a self-referencing hreflang link. If the latter is missing, it can confuse the search engines and hreflang annotations can be ignored.,  , You can manage your hreflang annotations via HTML tag in page header:,  , Or place them in HTTP headers:,  , Whichever method you are using you need to make sure each language- or region-specific page has a self-referencing annotation. For example, a Spanish version of your page must have rel="alternate" hreflang="es"  annotation with a link to itself.,  , Google’s guide to using hreflang. ​,  ,

Besides, it can mean poor user experience for your visitors. , There are many factors that can cause the Timeout issue. First, you need to check if the issue still persists. ​Open the reported pages in your browser and see if you get the same error. If so, you should probably consult the server log for more details.​​, Alternatively, contact your webmaster or your hosting support. Chances are your server is misconfigured, overloaded, or simply slow. If this is not the case, make sure that your site’s extensions (plugins, modules, add-ons, etc) work correctly., Another possible root of the issue is that your server might have started blocking our bot in the middle of the crawl. In order to resolve it, whitelist our IPs and reduce the crawl speed in the project settings if needed.​,

On one hand, hreflang annotations instruct search engines about the translated (localized) version of a page to be shown in search results based on users' language and location. On the other hand, the rel=canonical attribute on the alternate page version asks search engines, such as Google, to index another URL instead., Consequently, search engines may "overlook" alternate versions of your page and will not be able to point users to the most appropriate version of your page by language or region., There are two ways to resolve this issue:, You can replace the non-canonical URL in hreflang annotations with its canonical URL., If the URL specified in hreflang annotations was canonicalized by mistake, turn it into a canonical one.

Paragraphs: Learn more about the "Duplicate pages without canonical" error in Ahrefs' Site Audit and how to fix it on your website., This issue reports the pages that have duplicate content but do not declare their canonical version (don't have a canonical tag)., Although Google asserts that they can automatically choose the best version of the content to show in their search results, it won't necessarily be the page version you want to be indexed. That is why similar or duplicate pages of your website must have a "rel=canonical" attribute to instruct search engines to show the most authoritative (canonical) version of the page in search results., If you do not use this attribute to handle duplicate content, wrong page versions can be indexed., Choosing a canonical URL also helps to consolidate link signals for similar or duplicate pages into one preferred URL. Also, it is a proper way to manage syndicated content as the canonical URL can point to a different domain., Finally, canonical URLs can optimize your crawling budget as Googlebot will not be spending crawling time on duplicate pages., Note: ​Even if you indicated the preferred (canonical) page version to Google using "rel=canonical," Google may still choose a different page. Google uses quite a few other signals, such as http/https protocols, page quality, sitemaps, etc., Review all the pages with duplicate content listed in this report., Example:, The number in "No. of pages having the same content" column is clickable. If you click on it, you will get a list of pages that have the exact or very similar content to the URL in question., Within this group of pages, you should pick one canonical version that you want to be indexed in search results. Add its URL to the "rel=canonical" labeling on each page with duplicated content, including the canonical page itself., You can export the results into a .csv file from Site Audit if necessary.​ The canonical page can be specified by:, Using the rel=canonical <link> tag in the code of a page., Example:,     2. Using the rel="canonical" HTTP header in your page response. This method is especially applicable to non-HTML documents such as PDF files that can be accessed via multiple URLs., Example: , Only valid live pages must be specified as canonicals. Canonical URL must be an absolute URL specifying the protocol.E.g., use https://example.com/canonical-page/ Not /canonical-page/ ​See Google's guidelines on consolidating duplicate URLs., Alternatively, you can set 301 redirects for the unnecessary duplicate pages or simply take them down. ,

People landing on a dead page as they click through the link on your website can leave your website immediately., 404 URLs with a decent number of external backlinks are wasting the "link juice" for your website., A large number of 404 URLs on your website can waste the "crawl budget" for your website as the search engine crawlers will be attempting to access the non-existing pages via their internal and external backlinks., Generally, it is normal to have 404 pages on your website. Pages are removed and deleted on almost any active site. However, fixing the "404 page" errors on your site is not hard and will help your website on a large scale.,  , 1.

Paragraphs: Learn more about the "Broken redirect" issue in Ahrefs' Site Audit and how to fix it on your website., This issue reports the URLs that redirect, and the destination URLs return one of the 4xx (Client Error) or 5xx (Client Error) HTTP status codes., Example:, Neither the search engine crawlers nor your website visitors will be able to access these URLs via the links on your website. Crawlers will be forced to abandon the request while people will most likely leave your website., Look at the HTTP status code for the redirect URLs that cause this issue., For 5xx HTTP status codes, try to reproduce this server error in your browser. You should also check the error logs for your server., If this is an ongoing problem and a lot of internal pages return the 5xx code, you need to check with your hosting provider or with your web developers. Your server may be overloaded or misconfigured., One of the possible reasons for this issue in the Site Audit tool is the high crawling speed set in your project's settings. Some servers are not able to process a large number of requests at a given time. Try setting lower crawling speed in the crawl settings and run a project re-crawl., You should also note that this can be a temporary issue, e.g. when the crawl took place during some maintenance on your website's server., For 4xx status codes, click on the number of inlinks in the table to get the list of pages that link to the particular redirecting URL., Replace the links to redirecting URLs on these pages with direct links to relevant live pages or remove these links., Alternatively, you can set up redirects for 4xx URLs. However, this will create an unnecessary redirect chain. So we recommend using direct links where practically possible., Related: , SEO Audit: How to Fix Your Website’s Technical SEO Issues (Tutorial), What is Health Score and how is it calculated in Ahrefs Site Audit?, What does ‘4XX page’ error mean in Site Audit?,

Paragraphs: Learn more about the "Canonical points to 5XX" issue in Site Audit and how to fix it on your website., This issue reports canonicalized URLs where canonical links point to URLs that return one of the 5xx (Server Error) HTTP status code., Example:For https://help.ahrefs.com/en/, And https://ahrefs.com/help/en/ declared as canonical, returns any of the 5xx HTTP status codes (Server error)., Canonical links are used to solve duplicate content issues. If you have several pages with the same or similar content, you need to pick the most authoritative (canonical) version.​If the canonical page is not available for the search engines, they do their best to pick the canonical page on their own. And you might not be satisfied with their choice., Review the list of pages with the canonical link pointing to a 5xx URL. If erroneous URL was specified as canonical, replace it with the link to the valid 200 page version you want to be indexed in search results., 5xx (Server error) HTTP status codes indicate some server issues, and you should address your developer or hosting provider. Your server may be misconfigured, overloaded, or generally slow., There are different types of server errors, and they must be addressed in different ways. The most common 5xx errors are 500 (Internal Server Error) and 503 (Service Unavailable)., 500 error needs further investigation. It is usually caused by errors in application code or config files. Corrupted .htaccess file can often be the reason. PHP memory limit is another possible problem causing this error., 503 errors are temporary issues. They are usually caused by server overload or maintenance. These errors can indicate that you need a stronger web server, able to handle a bigger number of requests., Other possible reasons for the 5xx errors are:, Faulty plugins in your CMS (such as Wordpress)., Permissions issues with your files and folders., Some part of your website can be blocking our crawler (because of a firewall, DoS protection system, traffic blocks from certain countries, or a CMS configuration). Thus your website URLs may return 5xx codes to our crawler specifically., If you found that the crawl happened during server maintenance, run a new crawl to see if the 5xx errors persist., Another possible reason for this issue in the Site Audit tool is the high crawling speed set in your project's settings. Some servers are not able to process a large number of requests at a given time. Try setting lower crawling speed in the crawl settings and run a project re-crawl.,  ,

Title: "Duplicate pages without canonical" error in Site Audit | Help Center - Ahrefs
H2 tags: What triggers this issue?, Why is it important?, How to fix it?
Paragraphs: Learn more about the "Duplicate pages without canonical" error in Ahrefs' Site Audit and how to fix it on your website., This issue reports the pages that have duplicate content but do not declare their canonical version (don't have a canonical tag)., Although Google asserts that they can automatically choose the best version of the content to show in their search results, it won't necessarily be the page version you want to be indexed. That is why similar or duplicate pages of your website must have a "rel=canonical" attribute to instruct search engines to show the most authoritative (canonical) version of the page in search results., If you do not use this attribute to handle duplicate content, wrong page versions can be indexed., Choosing a canonical URL also helps to consolidate link signals for similar or duplicate pages into one preferred URL. Also, it is a proper way to manage syndicated content as the canonical URL can point to a different domain., Finally, canonical URLs can optimize your crawling budget as Googlebot will not be spending crawling time on duplicate pages., Note: ​Even if you indicated the preferred (canonical) page version to Google using "rel=canonical," Google may still choose a different page. Google uses quite a few other signals, such as http/https protocols, page quality, sitemaps, etc., Review all the pages with duplicate content listed in this report., Example:, The number in "No. of pages having the same content" column is clickable. If you click on it, you will get a list of pages that have the exact or very similar content to the URL in question., Within this group of pages, you should pick one canonical version that you want to be indexed in search results. Add its URL to the "rel=canonical" labeling on each page with duplicated content, including the canonical page itself., You can export the results into a .csv file from Site Audit if necessary.​ The canonical page can be specified by:, Using the rel=canonical <link> tag in the code of a page., Example:,     2. Using the rel="canonical" HTTP header in your page response. This method is especially applicable to non-HTML documents such as PDF files that can be accessed via multiple URLs., Example: , Only valid live pages must be specified as canonicals. Canonical URL must be an absolute URL specifying the protocol.E.g., use https://example.com/canonical-page/ Not /canonical-page/ ​See Google's guidelines on consolidating duplicate URLs., Alternatively, you can set 301 redirects for the unnecessary duplicate pages or simply take them down. ,

People landing on a dead page as they click through the link on your website can leave your website immediately., 404 URLs with a decent number of external backlinks are wasting the "link juice" for your website., A large number of 404 URLs on your website can waste the "crawl budget" for your website as the search engine crawlers will be attempting to access the non-existing pages via their internal and external backlinks., Generally, it is normal to have 404 pages on your website.
